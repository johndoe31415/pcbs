# TODO

  * Top and bottom polygon pours overlap the "user build" area with just
    unconnected pads, not sure what would happen during manufacture. Either
    find a way to increase the isolation distance or do not pour over those 
    areas.
  * The SMPS circuit is entirely unverified and I'm not sure if it even can be
    stable.
