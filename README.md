This is a collection of PCBs that I created, with everything from the schematic
to Gerber/Drill files for manufacture.

## Projects
  * 2019-07-18-stm32f103xc: STM32F103xC based core board. Includes breakout for
    the TQFP48 IC, crystal provisions, an MP2307-based input SMPS IC circuit
    that can generate 3.3V, an ULN2003AD output driver and a 74HC4050 input level
    shifter. The idea is that you only populate what you need and can use
    everything else. Created as a 100x100mm so that it fits Seeed Studio or other
    low-cost prototyping manufacturers.
