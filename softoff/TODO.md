# TODO

  * Bottom silkscreen URI overlapping the revision
  * Move Vin=Vcc away from pafs a bit
  * PIN/pad component has pad on the bottom side as well! Remove that.
  * Move silkprint of CD4011 away from via under IC a bit
  * Ext input seems wrong, goes directly to GND?
  * Aux input also seems wrong, second resistor does seem to NOT go to GND
  * 330nF silkprint overlapt BC847 outline
  * On schematic, add what On() and Off() Cs mean
  * On schematic, add voltage divider purpose text
